## WTP in developing countries using travel cost method

estimates of WTP in developing countries generally using the discrete choice travel cost method (Ted Miguel water quality paper). 


## WTP for environmental quality 

WTP for environmental quality papers and what design they are using to estimate (e.g., contingent valuation, stated preferences -- something from ecology)

I group the willingness to pay for environmental quality into articles by the environmental good or service being priced. 


Biodiversity:

- "Valuing the Diversity of Biodiversity" Christie et al. (2006) Ecological Economics

- Context: Cambridgeshire and Northumberland, UK
- Estimate the value of biodiversity under conservation scenarios comparing two different methods.
- Implement a both (1) a choice experiment for tax increases under different conservation policies and (2) a contigent valuation stated preference survey 
- 741 respondents to both settings
- Estimate implicit prices as $IP = \frac{\beta_{attribute}}{\beta_{tax-increase}}$ using a conditional logit model following Louviere et al. 2000
- WTP via choice experiment: "Here, although a move from continued decline to stopping decline and ‘ensuring recovery’ substantially increases well-being (£115.15), a move to ‘slowing down decline’ is negatively valued (− £46.68)"
- WTP via congintent valuation: "mean WTP is higher for Cambridgeshire respondents (£58.87) than for those from Northumberland (£42.47)"

- "Economic benefits of rare and endangered species: summary and meta-analysis" Loomis and White, Ecological Economics
- [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0921800996000298)
- Estimate WTP for 18 different species
- Contingent valuation with household surveys.
- Meta-analysis of 20 CV studies for specific species. 
- OLS Estimator
- WTP ranges from $6 for fish to $95 for northern spotted owls. Higher value for rarer animals.
