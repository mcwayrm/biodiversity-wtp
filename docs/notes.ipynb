        "\n",
        "This project aims to produce the first measure of willingness to pay (WTP) for biodiversity. \n",
        "This provides a monetary measure to value biodiversity which can be applied to a wide variety of applications in environmental economics and natural captial accounting. \n",
        "The data relies on E-bird observations of diverse bird species observations. \n",
        "The sample is limited to local, long-time users who are residents (not tourists) in India.\n",
        "The methodology to calculate WTP relies on a revealed preference throughh the random utility model (RUM). \n",
        "The RUM determines the value of seeking out diverse species of birds by comparing the value of alternative counterfactual bird siting locations and the cost to go to these counterfactuals. \n",
        "Monetary value is determined through the RUM by estimating the travel cost of the reveal preference compared to counterfactual locations. \n",
